Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. 
Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. 
In this homework assignment, I am supposed to develop a system for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. They include three tables which are employee, department 
and role.  

A command line application is created so that the user can do the following:
 - View Employees
 - View Departments
 - Add Departments
 -Add Employees
